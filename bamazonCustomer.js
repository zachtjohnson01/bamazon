// create MySQL database called bamazon

    // create a 'products' table that includes

        // item_id

        // product_name

        // department_name

        // price

        // stock_quantity

    // populate the database with 10 mock products

// require mysql

// require inquirer

// create user interaction

    // display all items available for sale (id, name, price)

    // prompt user:

        // id of product they would like to buy

        // quantity of units they would like to buy

    // verify store has enough quantity of that product to meet customer's request

        // if not, display 'Out of stock', and prevent order completion

        // if so, fulfill customer order

            // update SQL database to reflect remaining quantity

            // once the update goes through, show customer the total cost of their purchase
